# EnvoyAI Booking System Enhancements

## Overview

This document outlines the enhancements made to the EnvoyAI booking system to align its capabilities with the normal interface booking system. These changes ensure a consistent user experience across both interfaces.

## Key Enhancements

### 1. Admin Booking for Others

**Before:** In the AI interface, admins could only book slots for themselves, unlike the normal interface where they could book for other employees.

**After:** Admins can now book slots for other employees through the AI interface using either of these methods:
- Command interface: `/book <slot_number> "Employee Name"`
- Natural language: "Book slot 2 for Jane Smith"

### 2. Auto-Approval for Admin Bookings

**Before:** All bookings made through the AI interface required approval, including those made by admins.

**After:** Bookings made by admins are now auto-approved, consistent with the normal interface. The system automatically:
- Sets the status to 'approved'
- Sets the approved_by field to the admin's user ID
- Sets the approval_date to the current timestamp

## Implementation Details

The following files were modified:

1. `src/services/chat/ChatService.js`:
   - Updated the `handleBook` method to support booking for other employees
   - Added auto-approval for admin bookings
   - Added support for specifying an employee in the command arguments

2. `src/services/chat/OpenAIService.js`:
   - Updated the system prompt to inform users of admin capabilities
   - Enhanced the `bookTimeSlot` function definition to include employee parameters
   - Improved context handling for tool execution

3. Added test script `test-admin-booking.js` to verify the new functionality.

## Usage Examples

### Admin Booking for Self (Auto-Approved)
```
User: Book slot 1 for myself
AI: The time slot for Thursday, June 5, 2025, from 09:00 to 17:00 has been successfully booked for you. Status: approved.
```

### Admin Booking for Another Employee (Auto-Approved)
```
User: Book slot 2 for Jane Smith
AI: Successfully booked the time slot for Jane Smith on June 6, 2025, from 10:00 to 13:00. The booking status is approved.
```

### Regular User Booking (Requires Approval)
```
User: Book slot 1
AI: The time slot for Thursday, June 5, 2025, from 09:00 to 17:00 has been successfully booked. The status of the booking is pending approval.
```

## Benefits

1. **Consistency:** The AI booking system now behaves the same way as the normal interface.
2. **Efficiency:** Admins can manage bookings for their team members directly through the AI interface.
3. **Improved UX:** Auto-approval for admin bookings reduces unnecessary approval steps.
4. **Flexibility:** The system supports both command-based and natural language booking requests.
