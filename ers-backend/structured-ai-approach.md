# Structured AI Approach for EnvoyAI

This document explains the structured approach implemented for EnvoyAI to improve reliability and transparency in the AI decision-making process.

## Problem Statement

Previously, the EnvoyAI system had issues with:
1. Inconsistent booking behavior between command-based and AI-based interfaces
2. AI incorrectly reporting conflicts when there were none
3. Lack of transparency in the AI's decision-making process
4. Asynchronous operations not being properly awaited
5. Unclear error messages

## Solution: Structured Approach

We've implemented a structured approach that breaks down the AI's decision-making process into clear stages:

1. **START**: Understanding the user's request
2. **PLAN**: Creating a plan for how to address the request using available tools
3. **ACTION**: Executing the plan by calling the appropriate tool(s)
4. **OBSERVATION**: Analyzing the results returned by the tool(s)
5. **OUTPUT**: Providing a helpful response to the user based on the observations

This approach ensures:
- Every step of the AI's reasoning is logged and traceable
- Proper sequencing of operations (e.g., always checking available slots before booking)
- Clear error handling and user communication
- Consistent behavior across different interfaces

## Implementation

The structured approach is implemented in `OpenAIService.js` with the following key components:

1. **System Prompt**: Updated to instruct the AI to follow the structured approach
2. **Conversation State**: Tracks the current stage of the conversation
3. **Stage-Specific Instructions**: Provides context-specific guidance at each stage
4. **JSON Output Format**: Ensures consistent, parseable output at each stage
5. **Proper Tool Handling**: Ensures tools are only called at the appropriate stage

## Example Flow

Here's an example of the structured approach in action for booking a time slot:

```json
// START: Understanding the user's request
{
  "type": "start",
  "content": "User wants to book the Saturday time slot."
}

// PLAN: Creating a plan for how to address the request
{
  "type": "plan",
  "content": "I will first get all available time slots to find the Saturday slot, then check if the user has any existing bookings that might conflict, and finally book the slot if it's available."
}

// ACTION: Executing the plan by calling appropriate tools
{
  "type": "action",
  "function": "getAvailableTimeSlots",
  "arguments": {}
}

// OBSERVATION: Analyzing the results returned by the tool
{
  "type": "observation",
  "content": "Found 3 available slots for this week. The Saturday slot is available on 6/7/2025 from 10:00 - 13:00 with ID c95a3acb-408c-413e-b890-bced085ed37f."
}

// ACTION: Check for existing bookings
{
  "type": "action",
  "function": "getUserSchedules",
  "arguments": {}
}

// OBSERVATION: Analyze the results returned by the tool
{
  "type": "observation",
  "content": "The user has no existing bookings that would conflict with the Saturday slot."
}

// ACTION: Book the slot
{
  "type": "action",
  "function": "bookTimeSlot",
  "arguments": {
    "slotId": "c95a3acb-408c-413e-b890-bced085ed37f",
    "notes": "Booked via EnvoyAI"
  }
}

// OBSERVATION: Analyze the results returned by the tool
{
  "type": "observation",
  "content": "Successfully booked the Saturday slot. The booking is now pending approval."
}

// OUTPUT: Provide a helpful response to the user
{
  "type": "output",
  "content": "I've booked the Saturday slot (June 7, 2025, 10:00 - 13:00) for you. Your booking is now pending approval."
}
```

## Benefits

This structured approach provides several benefits:

1. **Transparency**: The AI's reasoning process is fully visible and logged
2. **Reliability**: Ensures proper sequencing of operations
3. **Debugging**: Makes it easier to identify where issues occur
4. **Consistency**: Ensures the AI follows the same process every time
5. **Error Handling**: Provides clear error messages and recovery options

## Testing

You can see a simplified example of this approach in action by running:

```
node ers-backend/structured-ai-example.js
```

This will demonstrate the structured approach without requiring an actual OpenAI API key.

## Implementation Notes

When implementing this approach in your own AI systems:

1. Define clear stages that match your application's needs
2. Use JSON output format for consistency and parseability
3. Ensure proper error handling at each stage
4. Log the AI's reasoning process for debugging
5. Make sure asynchronous operations are properly awaited
6. Test with various user inputs to ensure robustness
